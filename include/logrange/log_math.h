// log_math.h — LogRange runtime, v1.0.0
// Signed log-domain values and accumulation.
//
// Inherited from NativeConv; refactored per LogRange intent v0.3, Deliverable 1:
//   step 1: logsumexp2 edge semantics fixed (NaN propagates, +inf propagates,
//           -inf acts as log-zero identity). Previously NaN was swallowed and
//           +inf silently absorbed.
//   step 2: rp_accum pos==neg reset documented as an explicit error-bound
//           decision (see comment at the reset site).
//   step 3: predecessor baggage stripped — pinch helpers, approximation
//           toggles, polynomial fast paths, instrumentation counters.
//
// Representation: a real x is carried as {sign, log_abs} where
//   sign    ∈ {+1.0, -1.0}
//   log_abs = log(|x|);  -inf encodes x == 0;  +inf encodes |x| == inf.
//
// Precision: double only, by design. A scope decision, not an omission.
// Every constant in the error contract is double-specific — u = 2^-53, the
// ~745 log-unit vanishing window at the subnormal floor 2^-1074, and the
// mass-weighted depth term D that the same window caps. A float variant is
// therefore not a typedef: it needs the bound re-derived at u = 2^-24 with a
// ~103 log-unit window (2^-149, seven orders of magnitude coarser and a
// rescue range shrunk to a seventh), plus an accuracy reference finer than
// the double-double one the tests use. The compiler tooling already agrees:
// the rewrite pass declines float accumulators. Callers holding float data
// should widen at the accumulator boundary — the accumulation cost dominates
// the conversion.
//
// Known, documented limitations (accepted; bounds stated at the accumulators):
//   - Terms more than ~745 log-units below the accumulator's reference
//     exponent scale to 0.0 and contribute nothing. Correct for sums whose
//     result is dominated by the largest terms; stated here so it is a
//     contract, not a surprise.
//   - rp_accum's pos/neg partial sums are Neumaier-compensated (see the
//     struct comment for why and for the measured effect); pos_accum's
//     single sum is deliberately uncompensated — it is the speed path, and
//     positive-only sums have no cancellation to amplify its O(n·eps) error.
//     Worst-case bounds for both are stated at the accumulators below and
//     machine-checked in tests/test_accuracy.cpp.

// sums. Cost is one exp() per term; the final log() is paid once at
// reduction. This differs from the textbook streaming logsumexp (one
// exp + one log1p per term) and keeps positive/negative mass separated,
// which makes cancellation observable rather than silent.
//
// Error contract (v0.2, formal). Definitions:
//   u    = unit roundoff = 2^-53 ~ 1.11e-16
//   cond = sum|x_i| / |sum x_i|  (condition number of the summation)
//   k    = rescale events: adds that strictly raise m_log after the first
//          term. Worst case n-1 (sorted ascending input); expected O(ln n)
//          for randomly ordered input.
//   rho  = pos==neg reset events; A_j = largest |term| before reset j.
//   D    = mass-weighted mean insertion depth
//          = sum_i |x_i| * (m_i - L_i) / sum_i |x_i|, where L_i is term i's
//          log_abs and m_i the reference when it was added (so m_i >= L_i).
//          "Depth" is a gap in LOG SPACE — how far below the running
//          reference the term sat when its exp() argument was formed — not a
//          position in any traversal. That is why it is capped by the
//          vanishing window: a term ~745 below the reference scales to 0.0
//          and leaves the sum. Bounded by ~ln(n) for ordinary data.
//   S    = the exact sum; log|S| is the result's own log-magnitude.
//   net  = S / exp(m_log), the scaled sum the reduction takes the log of.
//          |log|net|| <= log n for positive sums, and <= log(n*cond) in
//          general. This is the OTHER addend of m_log + log|net|, and it does
//          not vanish when that addition cancels.
// Assuming std::exp within 1 ulp (true of MSVC/glibc/libm current), and
// n < ~1e7 so O(n*u^2) terms are negligible:
//
//   WORST-CASE RELATIVE ERROR  <=  cond * (3k + 4 + D) * u
//                                  +  (|log|S|| + |log|net||) * u
//     + terms > ~745 log-units below the running m_log vanish entirely.
//
// This is a FIRST-ORDER bound. It holds under the assumptions stated above —
// std::exp within 1 ulp, the vanishing window, and O(n*u^2) and higher terms
// neglected — not as an unconditional inequality over all floating-point
// behavior. Those assumptions are listed so they can be checked, not buried.
//
// The reset loss is NOT a separate unbudgeted term. The per-reset discard of
// up to A_j (documented at the reset site) is already inside the relative
// budget above, and the epochs are what make that work: a reset fires only
// when pos == neg, and the reference term contributes a scaled ratio of 1 to
// one of them, so both are >= 1 and that epoch's mass is at least 2*A_j.
// clear() starts a fresh epoch, so epochs are disjoint and
//     sum_j A_j  <=  (1/2) sum_j mass_j  <=  (1/2) sum_i |x_i|
//                 =  (1/2) * cond * |S|,
// giving a relative reset contribution of at most cond*u/2 — inside the 4u
// coefficient already present, with a factor of 8 to spare, for ANY number of
// resets. Disjointness is the load-bearing step: without it the sum over
// resets would appear to grow without bound.
//
// Derivation. Each term's scaled ratio r_i = exp(L_i - m_i) carries 2u from
// exp() itself (1 ulp, per the assumption above) PLUS the rounding of its
// own argument: fl(L_i - m_i) differs from the exact difference by up to
// u*(m_i - L_i) = u*d_i, and exp turns that absolute argument error into a
// relative error of the same size. So a term costs (d_i + 2)*u, not the flat
// 2u this derivation first claimed. The 2u is unchanged and still sits in
// the +4 below; D is the d_i*u that was missing. Terms sharing one depth
// share one rounding error, coherently, with no cancellation between them;
// weighting by mass share gives the D term.
// Each rescale event multiplies the standing sums by a factor carrying
// <= 2u (exp) + u (multiply); Neumaier compensation makes summation itself
// contribute <= u regardless of length. That is the (3k + 4) part, on a mass
// of sum|x_i|, amplified by cond at the final subtraction.
// The final reduction adds a term that never touches cond. out.log_abs =
// m_log + log|net|, and absolute error in log space IS relative error in
// linear space, so BOTH addends' roundings land on the result:
//   - log|net| is computed to a relative u, hence an absolute u*|log|net||;
//   - the addition itself rounds to u*|log|S||.
// For a sum near 1 the second is invisible; at log|S| ~ 700, the regime this
// library exists for, it is ~700u on its own and dominates everything else.
//
// *The first was missing until 2026-08-16 and is why the previous form was
// refuted.* Charging only u*|log|S|| budgets the rounding of the addition's
// RESULT while ignoring the magnitude of its INPUTS, which is the same defect
// as charging 2u for a term's exp() while ignoring its argument. The two
// addends cancel exactly when the sum is near 1, and there |log|S|| goes to
// zero while |log|net|| does not. bound_search's family E is the witness: n
// equal positive terms at L = -log(n) give cond = 1, k = 0, D = 0 and
// |log|S|| = 0, so the old form budgets 4u, while |log|net|| = log n. At
// n = 166463 the measured error is 7.97u against that 4u, a ratio of 1.99.
//
// These two are a division of labor, not rival explanations of the same
// error. Cancellation in forming net = (pos - neg) + (pos_c - neg_c) is
// covered by the cond factor: cond is large exactly when net is small
// relative to the mass, and it multiplies every coefficient perturbation
// that reached net. The |log|S||*u term covers something else entirely —
// the single rounding of m_log + log|net| once net is already known, which
// is a property of writing the answer down in a double and is there even at
// cond == 1. One is error in computing the value; the other is error in
// representing it.
// Without compensation the summation term is O(n*u) and dominates — measured
// at ~300x worse on cond=2.3e9 data (BENCHMARKS.md; a log_add fold is NOT a
// fix: its apparent accuracy there was an ordering artifact that collapses
// under shuffling).
//
// Two questions this contract carried as open, now closed by inspection:
//   - pos/neg rescale errors are bounded independently and added. That is
//     conservative under ANY correlation between them: the result is
//     (pos - neg), and |e_pos - e_neg| <= |e_pos| + |e_neg| by the triangle
//     inequality. Correlation can only shrink the realized error; it cannot
//     push it past the sum of the separate bounds. No change needed.
//   - the O(n*u^2) small print. At n = 1e7 that term is ~1.2e-25 against
//     u = 1.1e-16 — nine orders down, and it does not reach u until n ~ 1e16
//     terms, which is not an addressable count. The caveat is real but far
//     looser than "n < ~1e7" suggests.
// Status: REFUTED TWICE, corrected twice. The 2026-08-15 form
//   cond*(3k+4+D)*u + |log|S||*u was refuted 2026-08-16 at 1.99x by family E
//   above, once bound_search's reference was rebuilt to resolve it: the old
//   reference summed double exp() and collapsed to a double, floors of ~1u
//   and u/2, and a 1.99x violation of a 4u budget was inside them. The
//   reference is now double-double throughout (tests/dd_exp.h, ~1e-14 u) and
//   the missing |log|net||*u is stated above. Worst observed/bound across the
//   search is 0.83 against the corrected form.
//   The earlier cond*(3k+4)*u form was REFUTED by tests/bound_search.cpp,
//   which found 151 of 400 random inputs violating THAT superseded form
//   (worst 15.8x) plus a constructed counterexample at 5.8x with cond == 1,
//   k == 0. The same sweep scores every input against both forms; the form
//   above was exceeded zero times out of 400, worst observed/bound 0.85
//   (0.82 before the sweep widened to +/-600 magnitudes and mixed signs, so
//   the wider attack did press it harder). It is still an
//   author's derivation, now with an adversarial search standing behind it
//   rather than six fixed scenarios; independent review is still open
//   (TODO.md). Pre-1.0 this contract can still move, and CHANGELOG.md
//   records old and new values when it does.

// pos_accum — reference-exponent accumulator for positive-only log-domain
// sums (intent Deliverable 1: the positive-only fast path).
//
// Same design as rp_accum — reference log-magnitude m_log tracking the
// largest term, one exp() per term into a linear scaled sum, one log() at
// reduction — minus everything sign-related. Relative to rp_accum this drops:
//   - sign tracking (one branch and one store per add),
//   - the separate neg partial sum (cancellation cannot occur, so there is
//     no cancellation visibility to preserve),
//   - the pos == neg cancellation reset and its per-event error decision.
// That is the entire source of the speedup; the numerics are otherwise
// identical.
//
// Contract: terms are nonnegative. A negative-signed nonzero term is a
// contract violation and poisons — silently absorbing it (or folding it in)
// would hide a bug at the call site. Zero terms (either sign of zero) are
// the additive identity and are no-ops.
//
// Error contract (formal; u, k, D and S as defined at rp_accum):
//
//   WORST-CASE RELATIVE ERROR  <=  (n + 3k + 3 + D) * u
//                                  +  (|log|S|| + |log|net||) * u
//
// First-order, under the same stated assumptions as rp_accum's (1-ulp exp,
// the vanishing window, higher-order terms neglected).
//
// The n*u term is the uncompensated running sum — kept deliberately: this
// is the speed path, positive terms cannot cancel, so cond == 1 and there
// is no amplification for compensation to suppress. Typical randomly-signed
// rounding lands near sqrt(n)*u. Callers needing epsilon-level accuracy on
// very long positive sums should use rp_accum (compensated) and pay the
// ~1.5x per-term cost.
//
// The reduction terms are the same ones rp_accum carries: out.log_abs =
// m_log + log(sum), where log(sum) rounds at its own magnitude |log|net||
// and the addition rounds at |log|S||. Absolute error in log space is
// relative error in linear space. There is no cond here for either to hide
// behind, and neither grows with n — so at small n and large magnitude they
// are the entire error. Four terms near e^690 budget (n+3k+3)*u = 7u under
// the old form against ~500u of real error.
//
// |log|net||*u is carried for correctness, not because it binds here:
// |log|net|| <= log n for positive sums, and the n*u term already dominates
// log n. It is what refuted rp_accum, which is Neumaier-compensated and so
// has no n*u term to absorb it. Family E measures this rather than assuming
// it: pos_accum reaches 0.80 of its bound where rp_accum reaches 1.99 of the
// uncorrected one.
//
// D is carried for symmetry with rp_accum and is NOT the binding term here.
// Making D large takes ~e^D terms at depth D, so D ~ ln(n) < n and the n*u
// term already covers it. Measured rather than assumed: bound_search's P2
// family drives depth clusters at this accumulator and never exceeds 0.22 of
// even the old bound.
//
// Status: the earlier (n+3k+3)*u form was REFUTED by tests/bound_search.cpp —
//   119 of 400 random inputs exceed it, worst 34.9x, and every violation is
//   the missing reduction term. The form above holds across that search at
//   worst 0.79 at the time, 0.80 re-measured 2026-08-16 against the
//   double-double reference that replaced the plain-double one. Note this
//   bound had never been machine-checked before
//   2026-08-15: test_pos_accum asserted behavior, not the contract. Both
//   now check it.
//   - Terms below m_log - ~745 vanish (exp underflow). See header comment.
//
// Edge behavior (mirrors rp_accum):
//   - Adding zero (log_abs == -inf) is a no-op.
//   - Adding NaN or +inf log_abs poisons the accumulator: sticky, queryable
//     via poisoned(), every subsequent to_log_value() returns NaN.
//
// add_log(log_abs) is the raw fast path for callers who never materialize a
// log_value; add(log_value) validates sign and forwards to it. Both are part
// of the interface.
